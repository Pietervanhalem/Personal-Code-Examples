    "The `loadtxt` function has some basic functionality and works just fine, but when we have more elaborate data sets we want more sophisticated functionality. \n",
    "The most powerful and advanced package for data handling and analysis is called `pandas`. We will use only a few functions of the `pandas` package here. Full information on `pandas` can be found on the [pandas website](http://pandas.pydata.org/).\n",

The rows that need to be skipped are defined with the `skiprows` keyword (in this case row 1 with the `yada yada` text). The `skipinitialspace` keyword is set to `True` so that the column name ' car' is loaded without the initial space that is in the data file. And the `index_col` keyword is set to indicate that the names in column 0 can be used as an index to select a row."

    "### Resampling\n",
    "DataFrames have a very powerful feature called resampling. Downsampling refers to going from high frequency to low frequency. For example, going from daily data to monthly data. Upsampling refers to going from low frequency to high frequency. For example going from monthly data to daily data. For both upsampling and downsampling, you need to tell `pandas` how to perform the resampling. Here we discuss downsampling, where we compute monthly totals from daily values. First we load the daily rainfall in Rotterdam in 2012 from the file `rotterdam_rainfall_2012.txt` and specify the dates as the index (this is the column labeled as `YYYYMMDD`). We resample the rain to monthly totals using the `resample` function. You have to tell the `resample` function to what frequency it needs to resample. Common ones are `'A'` for yearly, `'M'` for monthly, `'W'` for weekly, `'D'` for daily, and `'H'` for hourly, but there are many other ones (see  [here](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.12.0/timeseries.html)). The keyword argument `kind` is used to tell `pandas` where to assign the computed value to. You can assign the computed value to the last day of the period, or the first day, or to the entire period (in this case the entire month). The latter is done by specifying `kind='period'`, which is what we will do here.  Finally, you need to specify how to resample. This is done by adding a `numpy` function at the end of the resample statement, like\n",
